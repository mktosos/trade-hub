This project is a trading platform that allows user who sign up, access to a secured platform which matches sellers and buyers and keeps a ledger of transactions. We allow sellers to list items for sale at a specific price. Buyers can choose what they want to purchase and do a trade with the seller or pay for it in site credits (which is not yet implemented).

The app will initially feature a video game trading site as the beta trading pool to work out issues. Eventually users will be able to trade and create various pools of items and conduct trades in the manner they see fit with in the rules and confines of our platform.

Known issues: As of today, many of the features do not work. This is an app in progress.

The app is built using a MERN stack. Mongo Db, express, react, and node js have been utilized.
